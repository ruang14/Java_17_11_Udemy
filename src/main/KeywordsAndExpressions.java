    //Expressions are essentially building blocks of all Java programs
    //Expressions are built with values, variables and operators, and also method calls
    //Datatype does not form part of the expression
    //Examples:
    // double kilometres = (100 * 1.609344); expression -> kilometres = (100 * 1.609344)
    // if (highScore == 50) {...} expression -> highScore == 50
    // System.out.println("This is an expression"); expression -> "This is an expression"
