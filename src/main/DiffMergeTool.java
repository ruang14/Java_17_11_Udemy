    //DiffMerge is a program that will help you to visually compare and merge files on any OS.
    //It can be very helpful with programming.
    //Some other tools like code repositories use similar merge operations, so this will also help you in the future when you start working with code repositories.

    //When you code along with the videos in the course, it is easy to make a typo, or get stuck, and this is where DiffMerge will help you.
    //Every lesson has the code attached to is that you can download in a zip file.

    //By downloading the code from the video and comparing it to yours, you will be able to find any errors made using DiffMerge.
    //With DiffMerge you can compare a single fine, or even the whole folder, and visually see the differences side by side.
